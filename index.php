          <p><span class="dropcap">H</span>unched over a keyboard, surrounded by computer monitors, Donny Moore, 37, controls the fate of the National Football League. Its players throw as hard as Moore wants. They run as fast as he says they should. And the stars of America’s most popular sport aren’t always delighted by his judgments.</p>
          <p>Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, for instance, was upset. “I want to talk about my speed,” Moore remembers Newton saying as he clambered into Moore’s cubicle last offseason.</p>
          <p>Despite <a href="http://pfref.com/tiny/exw5W" target="_blank">leading all NFL quarterbacks in rushing yards</a> in 2013, Newton ranked as only the ninth-fastest QB in the league, according to Moore -- hence, Newton’s unhappiness. But as Moore wheeled around from his den of screens, he was confronted by not only Newton, but also an enormous boot on Newton’s foot, the result of recent <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbleacherreport.com%2Farticles%2F2000678-breaking-down-cam-newtons-ankle-injury-and-surgery&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFCjeAQhBXvhbM9uiNoLk6rC7TyIw" target="_blank">ankle surgery</a>.</p>
          <p>“Yeah,” Moore said as Newton hobbled toward him, “let’s talk about your speed.”</p>
          <p>Eventually, Newton was pleading with Moore to not make him slower.</p>
          <p>Such is the power afforded Moore, a hyperactive Floridian who works as the official Ratings Czar[footnote]It says so right on his business card.[/footnote] for EA Sports’ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL" target="_blank">Madden NFL</a> video-game franchise.</p>
          <p>In that role, Moore is tasked with assigning more than 40 numerical grades to each of the NFL’s roughly 2,600 players[footnote]Including practice-squad members, free agents and other fringe players.[/footnote], evaluating them in categories ranging from passing accuracy to tackling ability. Moore’s process has largely been a black box, and yet it shapes how <a href="http://www.vgchartz.com/game/81573/madden-nfl-15/" target="_blank">more than 5 million gamers</a> simulate pro football -- particularly because there’s no official alternative to his numbers. A decade after signing a <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/big-deal-ea-and-nfl-ink-exclusive-licensing-agreement/1100-6114977/" target="_blank">controversial exclusivity deal</a> with the league and the players union, Madden[footnote]The namesake of retired coach and commentator John Madden.[/footnote] is still <a href="http://kotaku.com/5988357/remember-its-not-just-the-nfls-exclusive-license-with-madden-the-players-union-has-one-too" target="_blank">the only licensed NFL game</a> in town.</p>
          <p>In fact, an entire culture has grown up around Madden and its attempts to distill human athleticism into numbers. It is all good marketing for EA Sports but also speaks to the sway Madden holds. The ratings are a de facto time capsule from the year they were produced, a <a href="http://maddenratings.weebly.com" target="_blank">digital archive</a> that offers players some measure of immortality in a sport where the average career lasts only <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/240102/average-player-career-length-in-the-national-football-league/" target="_blank">a shade over three years</a>.</p>
          <p>“It’s important to these guys that they be rated 99 in speed; it’s important to somebody that he have the best arm in the game,” <a href="http://www.polygon.com/users/Owen%20S.%20Good" target="_blank">Owen S. Good</a>, a writer for the video-game news site <a href="http://polygon.com" target="_blank">Polygon</a>, told me.</p>
          <p>The allure of the Madden rating might also speak to the relative lack of meaningful statistics in football itself. It would be strange for a baseball player to complain about his ratings in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB:_The_Show_(series)" target="_blank">MLB: The Show</a>, for instance, because a realistic baseball simulator (by necessity) has ratings grounded in actual statistics. But in a sport where objective measurements are often inadequate, subjective numbers -- like those generated by Moore -- take on greater currency.</p>
          <p>All of these factors put more pressure on Moore to produce ratings of ever-increasing accuracy even as they highlight the fundamental paradox limiting Madden’s realism: It’s nearly impossible to accurately simulate some players as long as a gamer must assume control of the athlete’s brain.</p>

          <p><span class="dropcap">O</span>n the early December day I visited his cramped cubicle, tucked away in a corner of an office building on the EA Sports campus near Orlando, Moore was putting the last touches on a <a herf="http://www.easports.com/madden-nfl/news/2014/mark-sanchez-madden-ratings?utm_campaign=mad15-social-global-ic-tw-rosterupdate-wk14-120414-mad-tw-img-site-sust&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&sourceid=mad15-social-global-ic-tw-rosterupdate-wk14-120414-mad-tw-img-site-sust&cid=31592&ts=1421076967142" target="_blank">roster update</a> that would be downloaded later in the week by PlayStation and Xbox owners around the globe. When he was finished, 577 players saw some aspect of their skills re-evaluated on the basis of the previous week’s action. It’s an activity that Moore repeats every week of the season in an attempt to ensure that Madden imitates NFL reality.</p>

            <p>Moore’s employer, Electronic Arts, is the world’s <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/273838/revenue-of-the-largest-video-game-publishers-worldwide/" target="_blank">sixth-biggest</a> game publisher by revenue, and Madden is among its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_game_franchises" target="_blank">most popular</a> titles. The franchise <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/05/technology/innovation/madden-25/" target="_blank">has generated</a> more than $4 billion in revenue since its debut in 1988. Yet for all of EA’s resources, Moore performs his czar duties in surprising solitude. He’s assisted by a former Madden tester who oversees players’ cosmetic details[footnote]Their equipment styles, for instance.[/footnote] and the usual barrage of (ever-civil) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaiderGuru/status/124937245810630656" target="_blank">feedback</a> on Twitter. But when it comes to the task of managing a database of more than 100,000 player attributes, one of the <a href="http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/78391872" target="_blank">best-selling sports franchises</a> in gaming history largely leaves matters up to one man.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Moore’s job has morphed from a behind-the-scenes technician to a sort of celebrity -- <a href="http://www.gamezone.com/originals/donny-moore-is-the-most-hated-man-on-the-madden-dev-team" target="_blank">and villain</a> -- in gaming circles. And in an increasingly data-heavy sports landscape, it’s a role that sits squarely in two intersections of growing importance -- between scouting and analytics, simulation and reality. Because in both Madden and the post-<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMoneyball&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEC2JQw4wex8qG3YqQK2NTUxp4Q3A" target="_blank">Moneyball</a> sports world, humans become a collection of data points and then are turned back into a digital approximation of themselves.</p>
          <div class="ornamental-rule trigger-watch" data-callback="expandRuler"><hr><span></span></div>
          <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ranslating the athletic skills of flesh-and-blood humans into digital form has been a necessary part of sports gaming as long as real-life players have been incorporated into the software. According to Good, that practice dates at least[footnote]Good rightly cautioned me about the imprudence of declaring anything in gaming a definitive “first,” given the variety -- and, just as often, the obscurity -- of games and platforms in the medium’s history.[/footnote] as far back as the 1984 release of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroLeague_Baseball" target="_blank">“Micro League Baseball”</a> for the Commodore 64.</p>
          <p>“Micro League” was among the first sports simulations with a license to use Major League Baseball players on team rosters, an innovation that helped usher in the modern era of sports gaming. Developers were suddenly presented with a novel problem: having to represent actual players’ likenesses within the technical constraints of the day. One solution? Assigning numerical skill ratings to help differentiate good players from bad.</p>
          <p>“They were transitioning from primitive video games that were just trying to approximate the basic acts of a sport,” Good told me, pointing to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Oem60yvtUY#t=2m50s" target="_blank">Atari 2600’s sports titles</a> as examples of early games without rated players.</p>
          <p>“Basically, all players perform equally,” Good said. “They just wanted [to know]: ‘Do we have three outs and three strikes? You can throw the ball from third to first to put a guy out?’ ”</p>
          <p>But with the advent of licensed games, the stakes were raised. “You want <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gibsoki01.shtml" target="_blank">Kirk Gibson</a> to play differently from <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gwynnto01.shtml" target="_blank">Tony Gwynn</a>,” Good said.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The method of “Micro League Baseball” was to algorithmically translate a player’s real-world statistical benchmarks -- his batting average or home-run total, for instance -- into skill ratings that would presumably[footnote]It’s impossible to say because “Micro League” didn’t actually have the capacity to track statistics from simulated games.[/footnote] spit similar numbers back out on the other side of the simulation. It was effectively the computerized version of older board games like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Star_Baseball" target="_blank">All-Star Baseball</a>, whose colorful <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/oh5/kahnnection/gamespinner4.gif" target="_blank">spinners</a> reduced the essence of a ballplayer to a series of probabilities, locked in an eternal marriage with chance.[footnote]Perhaps it’s no coincidence that in another region of the baseball universe, the field of sabermetrics was tracing a parallel path at roughly the same time. Both endeavors were seeking to distill a player’s on-field performance to its numerical core, albeit for somewhat different purposes.[/footnote]</p>
          </div>
          <p>But player performance is <a href="http://skepticalsports.com/?p=478" target="_blank">notoriously</a> more difficult to quantify in football than in baseball. On the gridiron, detailed individual statistics are kept for only a handful of positions, and those numbers frequently <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/randy-moss-may-well-have-been-the-greatest-receiver-of-all-time/" target="_blank">miss the whole story</a> because of interactions between 11 players on each side of the ball. Game developers quickly realized that football players, in contrast with their cousins in baseball, would need to be graded on a wider variety of skills -- and that ratings-makers would have to temper the science with a whole lot of art.</p>
          <p>Early player ratings were simplistic. The <a href="http://www.baconsports.com/tecmo-super-bowl-the-best-video-game-ever/" target="_blank">legendary</a> “Tecmo Super Bowl,” released in late 1991, kept <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/587686-tecmo-super-bowl/faqs/44195" target="_blank">14 ratings</a> per player. But <a href="http://tecmogeek.com/about/rankings/" target="_blank">only a few</a> affected in-game performance for any given position. Meanwhile, the initial version of Sierra’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Page_Sports_Football#Front_Page_Sports_Football_Pro_.281993.29" target="_blank">Front Page Sports: Football Pro</a>, regarded among the <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-history-of-football-games/1100-6130897/" target="_blank">most sophisticated</a> football simulations of the mid-1990s, <a href="http://www.sierrahelp.com/Documents/Manuals/Front_Page_Sports_Football_Pro_-_Manual_Addendum_(fpsfxdoc).txt" target="_blank">tracked</a> just eight rating categories for each player[footnote]Acceleration, agility, hands, strength, speed, endurance, intelligence and discipline.[/footnote], with the same traits taking on radically different meanings depending on the player’s position. (For instance, a quarterback’s strength rating might refer to powerful throws, while the same category for a lineman would control his ability to block.)</p>
          <p>This did not lend itself to a great deal of differentiation between players.</p>
          <p>The assortment of skills that needed to be collected for each player grew as football games progressed through the 1990s. By the end of the decade, EA Sports’ NCAA Football series[footnote]Also developed by EA’s Tiburon studio outside Orlando.[/footnote] assigned <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/yt/thebirk/EAFAQnf.html" target="_blank">14 attributes</a> to every player in the game[footnote]Not counting the overall rating, which just serves as a composite of a player’s component attributes.[/footnote], while Madden began <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/tv/madden99/carolinar.html" target="_blank">handing out</a> 17. With the advent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(fifth_generation)" target="_blank">fifth-generation consoles</a>, the degree of complexity in simulating football increased dramatically, requiring a wider range of player attributes to feed into the new game engines.</p>

          <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t was against this backdrop that Moore began his professional affiliation with EA. He was still a student at the University of Central Florida, pursuing a degree in political science, when he noticed advertisements for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btxXRsqL4gc" target="_blank">“NCAA Football 99”</a> tournament at the student union. Moore and his roommates were devotees of the game -- he recalls elaborate house rules requiring that a witness be present every time a game was played in the friends’ shared <a href="http://www.chatsports.com/michigan-wolverines/a/Full-review-of-Dynasty-Mode-on-EA-Sports-NCAA-Football-14-10-2-4009" target="_blank">Dynasty Mode</a> savefile. On a whim, he entered the contest and won.</p>
          <p>Moore’s detailed knowledge of the game’s minutiae impressed NCAA Football developers on hand for the tournament. On the spot, they offered him a part-time job testing the coming edition of the game, a break he would later parlay into a full-time gig as an EA Sports football tester.</p>
          <p>Testing the games, Moore got a firsthand look at the give-and-take between gameplay and player ratings. He recalls the time a long-forgotten defensive tackle for the University of Kentucky inadvertently became a superstar after a typo assigned him a speed ratingfootnote]EA Sports’ ratings are on a 1 to 99 scale.[/footnote] of 85 -- blazing for a lineman -- and when the Oakland Raiders, long known for their <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2036826-speed-was-the-all-consuming-obsession-of-al-davis-raiders" target="_blank">real-life fixation</a> on speed, became unstoppable because the Madden game engine translated the overall velocity of the Raiders’ roster into far better virtual performances than the team was capable of in reality.</p>
          <p>Moore would eventually be promoted to a designer and producer along his path to Ratings Czar, but the relationship between Moore’s testing background and his current job is clear. “The [ratings] are probably the single biggest factor in gameplay,” Moore said.</p>
          <p>And the ratings have far more moving parts now than when Moore began working at EA. Each player in the game is graded in <a href="http://maddenratings.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/0/9/14097292/madden_nfl_15_-_full_player_ratings.xlsx" target="_blank">43 categories</a> -- many of which were added when Madden transitioned from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(sixth_generation)" target="_blank">sixth generation</a> of consoles to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(seventh_generation)" target="_blank">seventh</a>. There are also nearly 20 new player tendency tags, known as <a href="http://www.e-athlete.net/_/madden-nfl-15/madden-15-guide-to-player-ratings-attributes-and-traits-r109" target="_blank">“traits,”</a> that control specific player behaviors.</p>

            <p>Moore lobbied for many of the new rating categories, spurred by the same motivation that drove “Micro League Baseball” to add player ratings in the first place: greater differentiation between players.</p>

                    <p>A 75 overall rating for a rookie receiver is nothing to sneeze at, but that was just the beginning for the Giants wideout. Beckham recorded 31 catches in his first six games, raising his rating to an 80 overall by Week 11. And in front a national TV audience the next week, he hauled in 10 balls for 146 yards against the Dallas Cowboys -- 43 yards of which came on arguably the greatest catch in NFL history. Beckham’s rating would increase by 10 more points, and he ended the year with huge upgrades in awareness, route-running, catching in traffic -- and, of course, spectacular catch.</p>

          <p>“Some designers and producers complain that there are too many ratings,” Moore said of his colleagues. “They ask, ‘How can we limit the number of ratings?’ But I would argue you make players more vanilla with fewer numbers.”</p>
          <p>That’s why Moore wants to continue adding categories even if it makes his job progressively more daunting. “The developers and programmers hate this,” he said, “but it would be great to do more ratings.” He then launched into an only-half-joking suggestion that the game might add a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC8J6xmmhXU" target="_blank">long-snapping</a> rating someday.</p>
          <p>When Moore sits down to build a player’s ratings for the newest version of Madden, he goes through one of two separate processes, depending on whether the player is a veteran or a rookie. Each type of player offers its own challenges. Veterans have existing ratings from previous games, but the degree to which each of their categories must be changed is uncertain. Rookies, meanwhile, must be created completely from scratch.[footnote]There aren’t even college ratings to fall back on anymore; EA Sports put its NCAA Football series on hold in 2013.[/footnote]</p>
          <p>For the past few versions of the game, users can download Moore’s latest roster update every week of the season via Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network. That means a player’s ratings fluctuate based on how he plays each time he takes the field. To figure out whose ratings to tweak and by how much, Moore said he combines his observations and notes taken during games[footnote]Typically watched on the NFL’s RedZone channel[/footnote] with subsequent film study, conventional statistics, and -- increasingly -- advanced metrics from outlets such as <a href="http://www.footballoutsiders.com" target="_blank">Football Outsiders</a> (particularly for schedule strength) and <a href="https://www.profootballfocus.com/about/grading/" target="_blank">Pro Football Focus</a>.</p>
          <p>“The big factor during the season is stat-based,” Moore said. “The advanced metric sites like Pro Football Focus, like the Football Outsiders, this guy named Ryan Riddle -- [a] former NFL player who actually does <a href="http://draftmetric.com" target="_blank">a blog</a> that has a lot of great information -- those types of things bring out the snap-by-snap look on a player. And that, to me, gives a truer look in terms of a player's value, rather than the conventional ‘how many receiving yards’ or ‘what was the completion percentage for the quarterback.’ ”</p>
          <p>Pulling all that data together, however, is when Moore’s instincts take over. Listening to him describe the process of rating a Madden player across all 43 categories, I began to realize that he has unwittingly adopted a sort of ad hoc <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference" target="_blank">Bayesian updating</a> process. </p>
          <p>He said there’s a bit of “What have you done for me lately?” in the ratings but mentions that certain categories are fundamentally more or less prone to short-term adjustments -- another Bayesian-sounding notion.</p>
          <p>“Speed largely stays the same,” Moore said, “although when guys get hurt, I will make a change to [their] speed and agility” -- a fact Newton came to know firsthand. “Carry rating can be in flux if a guy fumbles a few times,” Moore continued. “Every position has certain ratings more impacted in-season than others.”</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, a category like “spectacular catch” can change on the basis of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApBsy3rALok" target="_blank">single play</a>. It’s a policy Moore defends by saying that particular rating has little to no effect on actual gameplay, though it also underscores the ad hoc nature some of Moore’s changes can take on.</p>
          <p>Such modifications will take a veteran player through the end of the season. Moore makes additional adjustments over the summer based on age-related factors and other reports coming out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp_%28National_Football_League%29#Organized_team_activities" target="_blank">OTAs</a> and training camps. “In the offseason, I look for guys trending up -- young guys -- or down -- older players,” Moore said.</p>
          <p>As for the rookies, their creation process dominates Moore’s spring schedule.</p>
          <p>Starting around March, Moore begins sketching out the ratings framework for projected draftees using a series of templates for each position. Working with measurables from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_scouting_combine" target="_blank">scouting combine</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_draft#Pro_Day" target="_blank">pro days</a>, he establishes a player’s ratings in categories such as speed and strength, which are almost directly tied to the drills performed by prospects in advance of the NFL draft. For instance, a 4.50-second time in the 40-yard dash will usually earn a prospect a speed rating of 89, barring particularly strong scouting comments about his fleetness of foot (or lack thereof).</p>
          <p>At the same time, Moore dives into the various public pre-draft scouting reports for each player, marking down pluses and minuses when consistent themes emerge and applying those adjustments to the templates in areas where the raw combine measurables are less useful, such as coverage skills or play recognition.</p>

          <p>How would you rate as an NFL rookie? Check out how you compare to NFL players with our reverse-engineered estimate of four of Madden’s main subcomponent ratings:</p>

          <div id="interactive">
            <iframe src="http://staging.projects.fivethirtyeight.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/madden-scores/"></iframe>
            <!-- Insert Interactive Here -->
          </div>

          <p><span class="dropcap">F</span>inally, after all the component categories are set for both rookies and veterans, the numbers are used to generate the fabled Overall Rating.</p>
          <p>When I asked Moore about this, I expected him to decline comment, citing a proprietary formula shrouded in secrecy. Instead, he cheerfully called up a spreadsheet containing the values that go into computing a player’s overall grade. And somewhat anticlimactically, the overall rating is simply a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean" target="_blank">weighted average</a> of a player’s ratings across the 43 skill categories tracked by Madden, with different categories taking on more weight depending on the position.[footnote]In fact, the overall rating generally doesn't use all -- or even most -- of the 43 component attributes at its disposal. Many categories effectively receive a weight of zero.[/footnote]</p>
          <p>For example, the most heavily weighted categories for quarterbacks in “Madden NFL 15” are awareness (about one-third of a quarterback’s overall rating), play action passing, and accuracy by zone (short accuracy is slightly more valuable than medium accuracy, which in turn carries a narrow edge over deep accuracy). Together, those categories make up about 90 percent of the overall grade for QBs, with the rest of the weight given to throwing power, passing on the run, agility and speed.</p>
          <p>By comparison, wide receivers see a large portion of their value driven by route-running, awareness and catching, which together make up about half of the overall grade at the position. The tail for important ratings at receiver is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail" target="_blank">longer</a> than for quarterbacks, though: Catching in traffic, release (which measures a receiver’s ability to freely run from the line of scrimmage against <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJdXTzkoVfE" target="_blank">press coverage</a>), and spectacular catching make up more than a quarter of a WR’s overall rating, with after-the-catch attributes such as ball-carrier vision, jukes, spin moves, agility, <a href="http://www.maddentips.com/madden-13-tips-truck-stick-running-game/" target="_blank">trucking</a>, elusiveness and even stiff arms also getting about 20 percent weight in the overall formula.</p>
          <p>Ever controversial, the overall rating is a proxy for a player’s all-around effectiveness on the virtual field (and, presumably, the real one as well). But how well do the ratings track with actual player performance? To get a sense of the relationship between simulation and reality, we compared players’ overall Madden ratings at the start of each season to their Expected Points Added:</p>
          <p class="chart"><img src="img/graphs/paine-feature-madden-1.png" alt="Madden and NFL QB Performance Graph" /></p>
          <p class="chart"><img src="img/graphs/paine-feature-madden-2.png" alt="Madden and NFL QB Performance Graph" /></p>
          <!-- Insert QB/WR Comparison Chart -->
          <p>Madden's ratings don’t perfectly match each player's seasonal performance, although estimates of a player's underlying “quality” may be distinct from the more random ups-and-downs of an NFL career. The ratings do appear sensitive to some reputation-based tweaking:  Eli Manning -- with his pedigree and two Super Bowl rings -- outrated Phillip Rivers in six of their 11 seasons, despite putting up a better Expected Points Added figure in just three of those seasons.</p>
          <p>In addition, the effects of the ratings on actual gameplay can be arcane for even the most seasoned Madden veterans. Perhaps no one outside of EA Sports has spent more time contemplating Madden’s inner workings than SB Nation’s Jon Bois, the creator of <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/breaking-madden" target="_blank">Breaking Madden</a>, a football column that doubles as an absurdist meditation on the game itself. But Bois confessed that he still can’t quite figure out what some of the rating categories actually do for players on the virtual gridiron.</p>
          <p>“There are definitely more obscure settings,” Bois said. “There’s a slider called ‘press,’ which I have no idea what it means. I set it to zero every time, and I still have no idea what it does, or what ‘press’ even is.”[footnote]After a little digging, I found that the “press” rating measures a very specific skill: the defensive back’s ability to jam a receiver at the line of scrimmage while lining up in tight coverage.[/footnote]</p>
          <p>It’s all laughs for Bois, who excels at turning Madden into surreal comedy. But the cryptic nature of the game’s growing set of player attributes can also have frustrating consequences for serious gamers. “The unfortunate thing for Madden is that a lot of [its] player ratings are opaque,” <a href="http://www.usgamer.net" target="_blank">USgamer</a> senior editor <a href="http://www.usgamer.net/archive?author=1105" target="_blank">Kat Bailey</a> told me. “There are so many systems going on that you don’t always know which [ratings] affect which [systems].”</p>
          <p>Bailey offered an illustration from franchise mode, in which a gamer uses a finite supply of experience points to boost players’ skills. “It can be unclear which ratings you want to increase,” she said. Spending experience points on awareness, for instance, will almost always increase a player’s overall rating -- but for defensive players and even quarterbacks, that boost won’t cause them to play better when they’re being controlled in-game. Meanwhile, wide receivers can actually see tangible in-game benefits from a higher awareness score.</p>
          <p>Confused yet?</p>
          <p>“I’ve heard it speculated that even the Madden team themselves don’t really know what’s going on,” Bailey said. “Because they’ve got years upon years of systems and code just layered on top of one another, where it’s not always entirely clear how they’re interacting.</p>
          <p>“It’s kind of a crazy system.”</p>
          <p>Whatever the virtues and drawbacks of Madden’s player ratings, though, they’re just a starting point. The game must still be played.</p>
          <div class="ornamental-rule trigger-watch" data-callback="expandRuler"><hr><span></span></div>
          <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you hang around the Madden studio enough, you’ll hear a curious phrase tossed around, a relic from games of a decidedly different genre and medium:</p>
          <p>“Dice rolls.”</p>
          <p>Although Madden takes pains to immerse gamers in the fantasy that they are controlling real NFL players, every interaction between two players in the game is also dictated by underlying probabilities, weighted by the various ratings of the respective players.</p>
          <p>As Rex Dickson, Madden’s creative director, said: “The way the game works on a high level is that when two players run into each other and are about to do an interaction -- let's say it's a ball-carrier and a linebacker -- it's going to take several ratings and throw them into a formula and do a dice roll.</p>
          <p>“The dice roll is how we get the randomness. So it's basically his break-tackle chance against your tackle chance and then a dice roll on top of that. The ratings mismatch is your modifier on the dice roll. If he's 10 points higher than you for his tackle rating, the dice roll is going to be favored in his favor to get the tackle versus the flip where it'd favor the break-tackle.”</p>
          <p>After hours of hearing this kind of talk during our visit to EA’s studios, my colleague Walt Hickey had a realization: This is basically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons" targe="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> for sports fans.</p>
          <p>If an obsessive following is a requirement for that comparison, consider Madden certified. The <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/7/21/5922939/madden-15-top-rookie-ratings" target="_blank">annual unveiling</a> of Madden’s player ratings is an event unto itself. Beyond just Newton, many NFL players <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_26389107/madden-ratings-guru-has-players-attention" target="_blank">grouse to Moore</a> about their numbers. (Kerry Rhodes, while playing safety for the New York Jets, made a YouTube video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXze0cQwD-8" target="_blank">“WTF Madden!”</a> demonstrating pretty conclusively that his throwing power rating was too low.) There are also <a href="http://www.fbgratings.com/members/index.php" target="_blank">sites</a> where amateurs, apparently dissatisfied with Moore’s handiwork, aim to create their own competing sets of ratings. And the ratings have even been deemed to constitute “likeness” in lawsuits such as <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a2xIJRSh5PE0&refer=us" target="_blank">Parrish, et. al v. NFLPA</a>.[footnote]In that class-action lawsuit, a group of retired NFL players sued the NFL Players Association -- and won -- over royalties that the union received from sales of Madden games containing classic teams with unnamed players whose ratings bore a striking resemblance to the talents of those teams’ real-life members. The unnamed players had “the same height, same ethnicity, same uniform number, same position,” Good said. “Although those things are very substantial in identifying a person, it was also that they would perform as you would expect that player to have performed in real life.”[/footnote]</p>
          <p>Bois told me that he thought the game does about as well as it can when it comes to converting real players’ abilities into a series of numbers. “If we were going to be entirely realistic, you’d probably have to have 1,500 different skill sliders” per player, he joked. “But this is a decent way to distill it into a thing that the layman can play around with and use.”</p>
          <p>Bailey agreed. “It’s an inexact science,” she said, “but for the most part [Moore] gets it right.”</p>
          <p>Yet for all of Madden’s quest for realism, there are certain aspects of football that the game still, and may always, have trouble simulating.</p>
          <p>On one level, sports video games give regular Joes and Jills the opportunity to perform athletic feats that most could only dream about in real life -- blazing runs, high-flying dunks, cannon-armed throws -- and games have gotten pretty good at simulating these aspects of what it means to be a professional athlete.[footnote]As NBA Jam illustrates, there’s no limit to how much a video game can crank up the dial on pure athleticism.[/footnote] But sports games will always struggle to accurately replicate the cerebral side of sports; that’s why it’s more difficult to <a href="https://feelingsarentnumbers.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/the-disappointment-of-digital-rubio/" target="_blank">simulate being Ricky Rubio than being LeBron James</a>.</p>
          <p>When I asked Moore what types of players Madden had the most difficulty simulating, two archetypes sprung to his mind. “There’s the Peyton Manning guy -- not [Tom] Brady or [Aaron] Rodgers because they have strong arms[footnote]Brady and Rodgers boast throwing power ratings of 93 and 95, respectively; Manning sits at 85.[/footnote] -- but the quarterback that’s pure decision-making, accuracy and touch,” Moore said. “And the crafty veteran wide receiver with the ability to find holes in zone [coverage], like Reggie Wayne or Roddy White.”[footnote]Both Wayne and White boast speed ratings beneath the average of 90 for receivers in Madden 15.[/footnote]</p>

              <p>There are certain player archetypes that have always been difficult for Madden to accurately simulate. The classic example is Michael Vick from Madden 2004; Vick’s speed was overvalued in the game. But less egregious examples occur whenever a gamer takes control of a player whose real-life counterpart possesses immense physical gifts but lacks awareness . The converse is also true; players whose defining skill is football IQ — Peyton Manning and Reggie Wayne, for example — are inept in the hands of an inept gamer.</p>

          <p>As he is wont to do, Moore suggested the latter could be better simulated with even more ratings or traits. “We could rate if a receiver was on the same wavelength with his QB,” he offered. After all, Moore loves to add to Madden’s stable of ratings.</p>
          <p>His pet example is passing accuracy, which was originally represented by a single rating but is now broken down into three separate classifications by distance. In previous versions of the game, the single rating was applied to the sureness of every throw, which failed to capture a big part of what makes each quarterback unique. In reality, some QBs have better accuracy on short tosses than deep bombs (think Brady), while others are better at judging long throws than short passes (Joe Flacco comes to mind). By splitting pass types into subcategories, Moore thinks he is better able to represent the characteristics that define different quarterbacks.</p>
          <p>Greater rating detail has also recently enabled Moore to address one of the criticisms that has dogged sports games -- and Madden in particular -- from time immemorial: that fast players are fundamentally overvalued. (Regarding the tendency for digital speedsters to far surpass the skills of their real-life counterparts, ESPN’s Patrick Hruby <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=hruby/090828" target="_blank">once mused</a> that “Oakland Raiders boss Al Davis should have been a game programmer.”)</p>
          <p>Moore doesn’t shy away from that critique. “When you make a guy fast in a video game, he’s just a little too effective,” he said.</p>
          <p>Take receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, a former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrius_Heyward-Bey#Track_and_field" target="_blank">track standout</a> who hasn’t exactly <a href="http://pfref.com/tiny/5gjsK" target="_blank">had</a> a great NFL career despite ranking among the league’s <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/11-fastest-40-yard-dashes-in-nfl-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">fastest players</a>. Heyward-Bey is just the kind of one-dimensional speedster whose avatar traditionally wreaks undue havoc in Madden, but Moore insists the revamped ratings have made it more difficult for those players to trick the game’s engine.</p>
          <p>Bailey confirmed this development. “It was true for a long time [that] the little speedy guys could just get open, and that was that,” she said. “I don’t think that’s as much of the case anymore.”</p>
          <p>But while speed can be mitigated, Moore granted that there’s no good way to overcome the problem of simulating a quarterback like Manning, whose most important skills -- reading defenses, calling audibles, seeing things on the field that no one else can, and making sound decisions -- are instantly negated when a gamer picks up the controller.</p>
          <p>“Quarterback decision-making is the most difficult thing to simulate,” Moore said. “We’re trying to simulate strengths and weaknesses as best we can within the game, but how you play the game is still you.”</p>
          <p>For example, one of the most important categories when computing a quarterback’s overall rating is awareness, which is based on experience and attempts to quantify factors like decision-making and depth of playbook knowledge. Awareness clearly affects how computer-controlled quarterbacks play the game; the lower the rating, the more likely a CPU opponent is to throw into coverage or miss open receivers. But despite its heavy weighting in the overall rating formula, a quarterback’s awareness score makes no difference when a human is controlling him. When you, the gamer, are in charge, it’s up to you to be “aware” for the avatar you’re controlling.</p>
          <p>Bois described the same conundrum using a basketball analogy. “I’ve found that the video-game version of J.R. Smith is incredible,” he said. “He’s just way better than he is in real life, and I think the reason is because you get to make the decisions and not him. He’s an amazing player, but once you distill him to his physical self, he’s just unstoppable half the time.”</p>
          <p>So at what point does an unaware Peyton Manning -- or an aware Smith -- cease to be a true representation of the original? It’s an interesting philosophical issue and one connected to the delicate balancing act between favoring skilled gamers and having virtual players mirror the strengths and weaknesses of their real-life counterparts.</p>
          <p>“It's a fine line,” Dickson said. “You want to make sure that somebody with great stick skills can still win and be successful but at the same time not transcend a really crappy team and all of a sudden they can beat anyone.”</p>
          <p>When that equilibrium is disturbed, the game can sometimes even be criticized as too realistic. In 2013, testers from Houston complained to Dickson after playing as the Texans’ undrafted rookie quarterback Case Keenum. “They all said, ‘[With] these computer physics, I can't have fun with this guy: Every pass is inaccurate,’ ” Dickson said. “We're watching film on [Keenum], and it's like, ‘Well, he's a third-stringer. Every pass is inaccurate. This is real life.’ ”</p>
          <p>“They said to us, ‘Well, if I'm good and making good decisions, I should be able to make good reads and get the pass there,’ ” Dickson continued. “But all of a sudden then you're making guys like Geno Smith look like Peyton Manning, and your stick skills are now superseding the simulation. We've actually had that in the game before, and it didn't go over well. People reject that.</p>
          <p>“You shouldn't be able, just because you're really good at Madden, to make Geno Smith all of a sudden awesome. Geno Smith, even if he makes a good read, is still an inaccurate passer.  That's just the way it works in the NFL, and that's modeled in our simulation.”</p>
          <p>Polygon’s Good used a baseball example to illustrate this tug of war between enjoyment and realism: “How do you make <a href="http://quotacrush.com/2011/07/19/fail-7-out-of-10-times-you-might-become-a-legend/comment-page-1/" target="_blank">failing seven out of 10 times</a> fun?”</p>
          <p>It’s a challenge that doesn’t seem to be completely solvable using player ratings, no matter how much faith Moore places in them.</p>
          <p>Then again, I doubt it will stop him from trying.</p>
          <p>“In a perfect world, in ‘Madden 2037,’ we might have [ratings] split into 10 or 15 different awareness-type categories,” Moore said, still rattling off items from his wish list. “Like awareness around the end zone, awareness in the fourth quarter …” </p>
          <p>“The possibilities are endless.”</p>

          <p><span class="dropcap">I</span> was on the 50-yard line, trying to make sense of the long slant route ahead of me. My debut was not going well. I was winded, slightly dehydrated and kicking myself after a day of mediocre runs and failed catches. The next pass was my last chance to impress, and I knew the cameras would be on me. When I heard “hike,” I took off. Eight yards out, I saw the ball above in a spiral. I jumped for it pitifully … and hit the ground. The ball was not in my arms.</p>
          <p>Before that pass, I knew I wasn’t cut out for the NFL. But when it sailed over my head, something else became clear: I was barely cut out for a video-game facsimile of the league.</p>
          <p>I was in Orlando with a crew of people who work on Madden, EA Sports’ premier football simulation, because I, like many obnoxious New York Giants fans, once had a fleeting moment of hubris. Sometime during QB Eli Manning’s 97 interceptions over the past five years, I thought: “Christ, even I could throw a better pass than that.”</p>
          <p>I cannot throw a better pass than that. Yet there was a sort of perverse appeal to the damage I’d bring to the Giants if I were swapped with Manning. What would happen if a schlub like me played in a league as unforgiving as the NFL? </p>

          <p>But these days, I don’t have to step on the field to know what happens when I step on the field. We have Madden for that.</p>
          <p>And shockingly, the people behind Madden were willing to turn me into a guinea pig. All I had to do was give them 36 hours and sit in front of a panopticon of cameras, and they’d turn my corporeal self into a digital one.</p>
          <p>I booked a flight to Florida. The most pressing issue on my mind: what my Madden ratings would be. The game (the most recent edition is “Madden NFL 15”) rates players on a scale from 0 to 99, basing overall scores on 43 categories, including trucking, deep passing, strength and agility.</p>
          <p>A guy like me was virgin territory for <a href="https://twitter.com/donny_moore" target="_blank">Donny Moore</a>, the Madden Ratings Czar. How exactly would he quantify the football ability of a person with hardly any?</p>
          <p>That I was essentially a rookie made Moore’s job even harder. As my colleague Neil Paine explained, rookies require an intense amount of research — game tape, college stats, combine performance — because they have no NFL experience to use for a rating.</p>
          <p>The only way Moore could draw up my forecast was by watching me play. On the agenda: the 40-yard dash, agility drills, and basic throwing and catching evaluations.</p>
          <p>After that was all over, I figured I’d be one of Jon Bois’s <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/breaking-madden" target="_blank">Breaking Madden creations</a>. For the past few years, in a series for SB Nation, Bois has been tweaking players’ stats to show what happens when those players are made superhuman or all too human. I expected to be in the latter category. </p>
          <p>But I wanted my avatar to at least get a point on the board, at least complete a couple of passes, and at least lead a team to one victory over several simulations (even if I broke an interception record for good measure). I wanted to show that the average dude could survive the rigors of the NFL.</p>
          <p>I’ve never exactly been an athlete. The last organized sport I attempted was three semesters of club crew in college. I reached out to my former coach, Nathan Walker, to get an independent assessment of my athletic priors. In an email, Walker said he didn’t imagine I was “the type of kid who defined himself through sports while growing up.” That is an understatement. I went to an elite-football high school but ran the debate team. </p>
          <p>He said that in my first year of rowing, I was “clumsy and awkward,” and my limbs didn’t quite go where I wanted them to. Nonetheless, he said, it was “a pure joy to watch” because I was passionate about it.[footnote]Walker added that he never considered me one of his top rowers. “Even though you pushed yourself at practice, you lacked that same self-discipline away from practice and would often stumble into morning practices having not slept the night before,” he said. That is entirely correct.[/footnote]</p>
          <p>Essentially, like most Americans, I’m not exactly out of shape, but I’m not exactly in shape either. I’m generally just a shape. </p>
          <div class="ornamental-rule trigger-watch" data-callback="expandRuler"><hr><span></span></div>
          <p><span class="dropcap">"Y</span>ou're going to be setting new ground in how low we go with the ratings,” Moore told me on my second day in Florida.</p>
          <p>But I still had a chance to succeed. In Madden, everything’s a weighted dice roll -- one player slamming into another isn’t an athletic act, it’s a probabilistic one. Even bad players like me could get lucky now and then. </p>
          <div class="sidebar-wrapper">
            <p>Take, for example, a player’s trucking score, which captures the ability of a player to run over a defender. Mine ended up being 9 out of 100, which makes me highly unlikely to take on Jadeveon Clowney and prevail. But my interaction with Clowney has an element of randomness -- that weighted dice roll could lead to luck for me and misfortune for him, which would mean I’d lower my shoulder and it would somehow push him aside. When I walked on the field to try out for the game, I found this idea oddly comforting.</p>

          <p>I strolled onto the gridiron in Orlando wearing old gym clothes and the cheapest sneakers available, which I ordered three days prior. I did the three stretches I remembered from my middle school Presidential Physical Fitness Test -- touch your toes, lunge side to side, twist your arm out of its socket -- and some light jogging.</p>
          <p>That may have tired me out more than I expected. My 40-yard dash and 10-yard split times were poor -- 6.75 seconds and 2.30 seconds, respectively. Those numbers were a problem because they determined my speed and acceleration grades, which are two of the most important ratings in Madden.</p>
          <p class="chart"><img src="img/graphs/hickey-feature-madden-1.png" alt="Walt Doesnt have NFL Speed Graph" /></p>
          <p>No player to participate in the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine since 1999 had a 40-yard time as bad as mine. The closest was Regis Crawford, a 316-pound offensive guard out of Arizona State who after the 2004 combine went undrafted. Crawford still managed to run the dash 0.70 seconds faster than me.</p>
          <p>Next up came agility drills — one shuttle run with three cones in an L-shape, another a 20-yard back-and-forth — that would determine how agile I wasn’t. I have the maneuverability of a rudderless aircraft carrier. Moore charitably characterized my style as “a real north and south kind of player.”</p>
          <p>Then came a lunging jump, in which I posted a consistent 6-foot, 5-inch leap. Moore seemed less appalled than he had all day. “Not bad there,” he said. It was one of the only times I felt anything approaching pride. </p>
          <p class="chart"><img src="img/graphs/hickey-feature-madden-2.png" alt="Walter doesn't have the worst jump graph" /></p>

          <!-- Insert hickey feature madden 2 -->
          <p>The quarterback drills brought me back to earth. Asked to throw the ball as far as I could, I threw it pretty consistently between 17 and 20 yards in an often-loose spiral. I then threw the ball toward my colleague Neil Paine, who was trying his hand at receiver, and connected only 40 percent of the time on short, medium and long passes. Watching the drills unfold, Moore said I was throwing the ball too low and would probably end up hitting offensive linemen in the back of the head often.</p>
          <p>When I had exhausted my arm, I did some receiving drills -- or attempted to. I was useless beyond 10 yards but caught each of the three short passes thrown my way. Brad Hilderbrand, a communications specialist for EA, said I could possibly be a great tight end. My pride swelled again.</p>
          <p>And then it withered the moment my foot touched a football. My range was so pathetic that I couldn’t boot it more than 20 yards, which at least doesn’t preclude me from being one of the league’s great onside kickers. Punting was no better. Any team with me as its punter would go for it on fourth down every time because I couldn’t kick it farther than 11 yards.</p>
          <p>"Offensive guard is probably your athletic skill set," Moore said at the end of the day. "But you're probably going to want to put on 100 pounds. So, that's going to be hard for you to bulk up there and still maintain the performance that you put on display today."</p>
          <p>Leaving Orlando, I reflected on the day and felt one thing above all: extreme pain. My back was seizing up, my right arm went somewhat numb, and a nap had only made me more sore. When I got home in the wee-morning hours, I took enough ibuprofen to dull my senses and decided that I should exercise more often.[footnote]I have not.[/footnote] The soreness continued for three more days.</p>
          <div class="ornamental-rule trigger-watch" data-callback="expandRuler"><hr><span></span></div>
          <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>wo months later, Moore and company asked me to return to Florida for the big reveal: what I’d look like as a real (fake), live (artificial) NFL (Madden) player. When I was first in Florida, EA mapped my face for an avatar by putting me in front of 12 high-definition cameras, each poised at a slightly different angle. It looked like what Jeremy Bentham would have made if he had gone into photography after he was tired of designing prisons.</p>
          <p>I posed seven ways — one mugshot, left and right profile shots, a natural smile[footnote]Presumably to be used in event of a successful play in-game, so essentially unnecessary.[/footnote], one with my mouth slightly open,[footnote]I just made a Manningface.[/footnote], one with a wrinkled forehead and eight chins, and one screaming.[footnote]When I saw the photos in December, they looked like I had just walked out of an anti-methamphetamine advertisement. The photos came with polarized flashes that stripped my face of any shadow. Zooming in on the high-def shots made it look like I had slept in hot grease. Will Gibson, the technician who took the photos, said they made me look sort of like Ray Romano.</p>
          <p>But this, he said, was the point. “Put Brad Pitt in front of this,” he said, “and he’d look like Steve Buscemi.”[/footnote]</p>
          <p>When I first met my avatar, it was like staring into a mirror set up across the uncanny valley. My facial features were nearly exact, down to the barely noticeable scar on my chin. But I looked disoriented -- even more disoriented than I was on the day of the shoot. My neck lolled; my eyes were glazed over; my blinking was algorithmic.</p>
          <p>My avatar played just as strangely as it looked. We’re used to playing Madden with athletes who have remarkable skill sets; they move quickly, consistently and responsively. I did not. It was like driving in the snow: You know how the car is supposed to move, but it just doesn’t behave as expected. </p>
          <p>This is what happens when your Madden score is 12. A 12 out of 100 is bad. Very bad. The lowest-rated player in “Madden NFL 15” is Jacksonville Jaguars long snapper Carson Tinker, who has a 41.</p>
          <p class="chart"><img src="img/graphs/hickey-feature-madden-4.png" alt="Madden has some grade inflation" /></p>
          <p class="chart">And yet I won some games as quarterback. In the 15 seasons that EA simulated with me as QB for the Giants[footnote]Using the 2014 roster each time.[/footnote], the team never had a winning season but did win an average of 2.9 games each year. Head coach Tom Coughlin was also fired every season. So, win some, lose some.</p>
          <p>Moore also simulated me as a receiver, kicker and punter, which also dragged the Giants down. The team had an average of 3.3 wins with me as a receiver, 3.5 wins with me at kicker, and 3.8 wins with me at punter. Somehow, I made 95 percent of extra-point attempts, and my average punt was 27 yards. Skeptical, I emailed Moore to see whether the game might be flawed. “It might be one of those things in our simulation where it might not simulate the Extra-Point kicks based off of ratings enough,” he said. Even my achievements may have happened in error.</p>

          <p>Maybe the only thing causing me to play poorly was that I wasn’t playing as myself. I challenged Madden’s creative director, Rex Dickson, to a scrimmage. Starting at QB for the Giants: Walt Hickey.</p>
          <p>Hickey did not have a good day. He threw 7 for 25, threw three interceptions and was sacked three times. The Giants lost 42-7. The only points came thanks to wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who could make any quarterback look good. He scored on a short pass that he turned into a 94-yard touchdown. My only comfort was to imagine the great headline that the New York Post would put on its back page the next day: “Hickey Fails to Leave a Mark.”</p>

          <p>Moore looked relieved during the scrimmage. My abysmal performance was proof that Madden really is a simulation of the NFL: A player who somehow lucks into the league without any skills really doesn’t have a chance. He’d have to rely on his teammates to compensate. Thankfully, Madden doesn’t allow for locker-room coups. </p>
          <p>I will never on my best day be as good as Manning on his worst day.</p>
          <p>And yet, Madden was way too kind. The Giants should have been so, so much worse with me at the helm. My avatar couldn’t have been rated much lower. I was far closer to a zero rating than I was to the lowest legitimate athlete in the game (Tinker, the long snapper). Despite that, my avatar still managed to lead a team to a little less than three wins a year on average? That doesn’t make sense. The Giants went 6-10 last season. There’s no way Eli Manning is only three wins above Walt Hickey.</p>
          <p>All we need to do to demonstrate this is to look at the team that performed exactly as I expect mine would: the 2008 Detroit Lions. Although that team was among the worst of all time and failed to win a game, it was made up of talented players who were each still vastly better athletes than I am. Indeed, that year, the overall rating for four Lions quarterbacks  — Daunte Culpepper (80), Jon Kitna (84), Dan Orlovsky (73) and Drew Stanton (77) — vastly exceeded my rating.</p>
          <p>Factor in my shocking kicking performance (maybe I could make 95 percent of extra-point attempts on, say, the moon or some other low-gravity satellite), and I think that even my low stats fail to encapsulate just how bad (or rather how normal) I am. Madden’s simulation is geared to work within a realm of athleticism that I am not a resident of. To articulate my actual performance on the field, I’d probably need a negative rating.</p>
          <p>Despite the praise during practice — that I had more of an offensive-guard skill set, that I could be a tight end, that I was “a real north and south kind of player” — when it comes down to it, I’m clumsy and awkward, my limbs don’t quite go where I want them to go, and at best, it’s just fun to watch me. Generally speaking, I don’t think a regular person could compete with the pros. Most people are, at best, somewhat good at something. But greatness — regularly scheduled weekly articulations of greatness — is something that just can’t be turned on.</p>
          <p>I asked Moore whether there were any sports that regular people could jump into and be somewhat competitive. </p>
          <p>“Poker, if you consider that a sport,” he said.</p>
          <p>Mohegan Sun has <a href="http://mohegansun.com/playing/poker.html" target="_blank">a poker tournament</a> at the end of the month. How hard can that be?</p>
