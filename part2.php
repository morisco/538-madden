          <p><span class="dropcap">I</span> was on the 50-yard line, trying to make sense of the long slant route ahead of me. My debut was not going well. I was winded, slightly dehydrated and kicking myself after a day of mediocre runs and failed catches. The next pass was my last chance to impress, and I knew the cameras would be on me. When I heard &ldquo;hike,&rdquo; I took off. Eight yards out, I saw the ball above in a spiral. I jumped for it pitifully … and hit the ground. The ball was not in my arms.</p>
          <p>Before that pass, I knew I wasn&rsquo;t cut out for the NFL. But when it sailed over my head, something else became clear: I was barely cut out for a video-game facsimile of the league.</p>
          <p>I was in Orlando with a crew of people who work on Madden, EA Sports&rsquo; premier football simulation, because I, like many obnoxious New York Giants fans, once had a fleeting moment of hubris. Sometime during QB Eli Manning&rsquo;s 97 interceptions over the past five years, I thought: &ldquo;Christ, even I could throw a better pass than that.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>I cannot throw a better pass than that. Yet there was a sort of perverse appeal to the damage I&rsquo;d bring to the Giants if I were swapped with Manning. What would happen if a schlub like me played in a league as unforgiving as the NFL? </p>

            <p>Actual participation was out of the question.

I&rsquo;m not getting near the turf of an actual football field. Plus, my insurance isn&rsquo;t that great.</p>

          <p>But these days, I don&rsquo;t have to step on the field to know what happens when I step on the field. We have Madden for that.</p>
          <p>And shockingly, the people behind Madden were willing to turn me into a guinea pig. All I had to do was give them 36 hours and sit in front of a panopticon of cameras, and they&rsquo;d turn my corporeal self into a digital one.</p>
          <p>I booked a flight to Florida. The most pressing issue on my mind: what my Madden ratings would be. The game (the most recent edition is &ldquo;Madden NFL 15&rdquo;) rates players on a scale from 0 to 99, basing overall scores on 43 categories, including trucking, deep passing, strength and agility.</p>
          <p>A guy like me was virgin territory for <a href="https://twitter.com/donny_moore" target="_blank">Donny Moore</a>, the Madden Ratings Czar. How exactly would he quantify the football ability of a person with hardly any?</p>
          <p>That I was essentially a rookie made Moore&rsquo;s job even harder. As my colleague Neil Paine explained, rookies require an intense amount of research — game tape, college stats, combine performance — because they have no NFL experience to use for a rating.</p>
          <p>The only way Moore could draw up my forecast was by watching me play. On the agenda: the 40-yard dash, agility drills, and basic throwing and catching evaluations.</p>
          <p>After that was all over, I figured I&rsquo;d be one of Jon Bois&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/breaking-madden" target="_blank">Breaking Madden creations</a>. For the past few years, in a series for SB Nation, Bois has been tweaking players&rsquo; stats to show what happens when those players are made superhuman or all too human. I expected to be in the latter category. </p>
          <p>But I wanted my avatar to at least get a point on the board, at least complete a couple of passes, and at least lead a team to one victory over several simulations (even if I broke an interception record for good measure). I wanted to show that the average dude could survive the rigors of the NFL.</p>
          <p>I&rsquo;ve never exactly been an athlete. The last organized sport I attempted was three semesters of club crew in college. I reached out to my former coach, Nathan Walker, to get an independent assessment of my athletic priors. In an email, Walker said he didn&rsquo;t imagine I was &ldquo;the type of kid who defined himself through sports while growing up.&rdquo; That is an understatement. I went to an elite-football high school but ran the debate team. </p>
          <p>He said that in my first year of rowing, I was &ldquo;clumsy and awkward,&rdquo; and my limbs didn&rsquo;t quite go where I wanted them to. Nonetheless, he said, it was &ldquo;a pure joy to watch&rdquo; because I was passionate about it.<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" href="#fn-1"><sup id="ss-1">1</sup></a></p>
          <p>Essentially, like most Americans, I&rsquo;m not exactly out of shape, but I&rsquo;m not exactly in shape either. I&rsquo;m generally just a shape. </p>
          <div class="ornamental-rule trigger-watch" data-callback="expandRuler"><hr><span></span></div>
          <p><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;Y</span>ou're going to be setting new ground in how low we go with the ratings,&rdquo; Moore told me on my second day in Florida.</p>
          <p>But I still had a chance to succeed. In Madden, everything&rsquo;s a weighted dice roll &#8212; one player slamming into another isn&rsquo;t an athletic act, it&rsquo;s a probabilistic one. Even bad players like me could get lucky now and then. </p>
          <div class="sidebar-wrapper">
            <p>Take, for example, a player&rsquo;s trucking score, which captures the ability of a player to run over a defender. Mine ended up being 9 out of 100, which makes me highly unlikely to take on Jadeveon Clowney and prevail. But my interaction with Clowney has an element of randomness &#8212; that weighted dice roll could lead to luck for me and misfortune for him, which would mean I&rsquo;d lower my shoulder and it would somehow push him aside. When I walked on the field to try out for the game, I found this idea oddly comforting.</p>

          <p>I strolled onto the gridiron in Orlando wearing old gym clothes and the cheapest sneakers available, which I ordered three days prior. I did the three stretches I remembered from my middle school Presidential Physical Fitness Test &#8212; touch your toes, lunge side to side, twist your arm out of its socket &#8212; and some light jogging.</p>
          <p>That may have tired me out more than I expected. My 40-yard dash and 10-yard split times were poor &#8212; 6.75 seconds and 2.30 seconds, respectively. Those numbers were a problem because they determined my speed and acceleration grades, which are two of the most important ratings in Madden.</p>
          <p class="chart"><img src="<?php echo esc_url( $fte_madden->get_special_directory_uri() ); ?>/img/graphs/hickey-feature-madden-1.png" alt="Walt Doesnt have NFL Speed Graph" /></p>
          <p>No player to participate in the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine since 1999 had a <a href="http://nflcombineresults.com/" target="_blank">40-yard time as bad</a> as mine<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" href="#fn-2"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></a>. The closest was Regis Crawford, a 316-pound offensive guard out of Arizona State who after the 2004 combine went undrafted. Crawford still managed to run the dash 0.70 seconds faster than me.</p>
          <p>Next up came agility drills — one shuttle run with three cones in an L-shape, another a 20-yard back-and-forth — that would determine how agile I wasn&rsquo;t. I have the maneuverability of a rudderless aircraft carrier. Moore charitably characterized my style as &ldquo;a real north and south kind of player.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Then came a lunging jump, in which I posted a consistent 6-foot, 5-inch leap. Moore seemed less appalled than he had all day. &ldquo;Not bad there,&rdquo; he said. It was one of the only times I felt anything approaching pride. </p>
          <p class="chart"><img src="<?php echo esc_url( $fte_madden->get_special_directory_uri() ); ?>/img/graphs/hickey-feature-madden-2.png" alt="Walter doesn't have the worst jump graph" /></p>

          <p>The quarterback drills brought me back to earth. Asked to throw the ball as far as I could, I threw it pretty consistently between 17 and 20 yards in an often-loose spiral. I then threw the ball toward my colleague Neil Paine, who was trying his hand at receiver, and connected only 40 percent of the time on short, medium and long passes. Watching the drills unfold, Moore said I was throwing the ball too low and would probably end up hitting offensive linemen in the back of the head often.</p>
          <p>When I had exhausted my arm, I did some receiving drills &#8212; or attempted to. I was useless beyond 10 yards but caught each of the three short passes thrown my way. Brad Hilderbrand, a communications specialist for EA, said I could possibly be a great tight end. My pride swelled again.</p>
          <p>And then it withered the moment my foot touched a football. My range was so pathetic that I couldn&rsquo;t boot it more than 20 yards, which at least doesn&rsquo;t preclude me from being one of the league&rsquo;s great onside kickers. Punting was no better. Any team with me as its punter would go for it on fourth down every time because I couldn&rsquo;t kick it farther than 11 yards.</p>
          <p>"Offensive guard is probably your athletic skill set," Moore said at the end of the day. "But you're probably going to want to put on 100 pounds. So, that's going to be hard for you to bulk up there and still maintain the performance that you put on display today."</p>
          <p>Leaving Orlando, I reflected on the day and felt one thing above all: extreme pain. My back was seizing up, my right arm went somewhat numb, and a nap had only made me more sore. When I got home in the wee-morning hours, I took enough ibuprofen to dull my senses and decided that I should exercise more often.<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" href="#fn-2"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></a> The soreness continued for three more days.</p>
          <div class="ornamental-rule trigger-watch" data-callback="expandRuler"><hr><span></span></div>
          <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>wo months later, Moore and company asked me to return to Florida for the big reveal: what I&rsquo;d look like as a real (fake), live (artificial) NFL (Madden) player. When I was first in Florida, EA mapped my face for an avatar by putting me in front of 12 high-definition cameras, each poised at a slightly different angle. It looked like what Jeremy Bentham would have made if he had gone into photography after he was tired of designing prisons.</p>
          <p>I posed seven ways — one mugshot, left and right profile shots, a natural smile<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" href="#fn-3"><sup id="ss-3">3</sup></a>, one with my mouth slightly open,<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" href="#fn-4"><sup id="ss-4">4</sup></a>, one with a wrinkled forehead and eight chins, and one screaming. When I saw the photos in December, they looked like I had just walked out of an anti-methamphetamine advertisement. The photos came with polarized flashes that stripped my face of any shadow. Zooming in on the high-def shots made it look like I had slept in hot grease. Will Gibson, the technician who took the photos, said they made me look sort of like Ray Romano.</p>
          <p>But this, he said, was the point. &ldquo;Put Brad Pitt in front of this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;d look like Steve Buscemi.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="chart">
            <img src="<?php echo esc_url( $fte_madden->get_special_directory_uri() ); ?>/img/face-scan.jpg" alt="Walter Hickey Digital Face Scan" />
            <span class="caption">Clockwise, top left: Hickey poses in front of the cameras; the computer builds a 3D model of Hickey&rsquo;s face based on his photos; skin tone and facial detail are added; Hickey&rsquo;s final rendering</span>
          </p>
          <p>When I first met my avatar, it was like staring into a mirror set up across the uncanny valley. My facial features were nearly exact, down to the barely noticeable scar on my chin. But I looked disoriented &#8212; even more disoriented than I was on the day of the shoot. My neck lolled; my eyes were glazed over; my blinking was algorithmic.</p>
          <p>My avatar played just as strangely as it looked. We&rsquo;re used to playing Madden with athletes who have remarkable skill sets; they move quickly, consistently and responsively. I did not. It was like driving in the snow: You know how the car is supposed to move, but it just doesn&rsquo;t behave as expected. </p>
          <p>This is what happens when your Madden score is 12. A 12 out of 100 is bad. Very bad. The lowest-rated player in &ldquo;Madden NFL 15&rdquo; is Jacksonville Jaguars long snapper Carson Tinker, who has a 41.</p>
          <p class="chart"><img src="<?php echo esc_url( $fte_madden->get_special_directory_uri() ); ?>/img/graphs/hickey-feature-madden-4.png" alt="Madden has some grade inflation" /></p>
          <p>And yet I won some games as quarterback. In the 15 seasons that EA simulated with me as QB for the Giants<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" href="#fn-5"><sup id="ss-5">5</sup></a>, the team never had a winning season but did win an average of 2.9 games each year. Head coach Tom Coughlin was also fired every season. So, win some, lose some.</p>
          <p>Moore also simulated me as a receiver, kicker and punter, which also dragged the Giants down. The team had an average of 3.3 wins with me as a receiver, 3.5 wins with me at kicker, and 3.8 wins with me at punter. Somehow, I made 95 percent of extra-point attempts, and my average punt was 27 yards. Skeptical, I emailed Moore to see whether the game might be flawed. &ldquo;It might be one of those things in our simulation where it might not simulate the Extra-Point kicks based off of ratings enough,&rdquo; he said. Even my achievements may have happened in error.</p>
          <p class="chart"><img src="<?php echo esc_url( $fte_madden->get_special_directory_uri() ); ?>/img/graphs/hickey-feature-madden-3.png" alt="How did madden walt do?" /></p>
          <p>Maybe the only thing causing me to play poorly was that I wasn&rsquo;t playing as myself. I challenged Madden&rsquo;s creative director, Rex Dickson, to a scrimmage. Starting at QB for the Giants: Walt Hickey.</p>
          <p>Hickey did not have a good day. He threw 7 for 25, threw three interceptions and was sacked three times. The Giants lost 42-7. The only points came thanks to wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who could make any quarterback look good. He scored on a short pass that he turned into a 94-yard touchdown. My only comfort was to imagine the great headline that the New York Post would put on its back page the next day: &ldquo;Hickey Fails to Leave a Mark.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>Moore looked relieved during the scrimmage. My abysmal performance was proof that Madden really is a simulation of the NFL: A player who somehow lucks into the league without any skills really doesn&rsquo;t have a chance. He&rsquo;d have to rely on his teammates to compensate. Thankfully, Madden doesn&rsquo;t allow for locker-room coups. </p>
          <p>I will never on my best day be as good as Manning on his worst day.</p>
          <p>And yet, Madden was way too kind. The Giants should have been so, so much worse with me at the helm. My avatar couldn&rsquo;t have been rated much lower. I was far closer to a zero rating than I was to the lowest legitimate athlete in the game (Tinker, the long snapper). Despite that, my avatar still managed to lead a team to a little less than three wins a year on average? That doesn&rsquo;t make sense. The Giants went 6-10 last season. There&rsquo;s no way Eli Manning is only three wins above Walt Hickey.</p>
          <p>All we need to do to demonstrate this is to look at the team that performed exactly as I expect mine would: the 2008 Detroit Lions. Although that team was among the worst of all time and failed to win a game, it was made up of talented players who were each still vastly better athletes than I am. Indeed, that year, the overall rating for four Lions quarterbacks  — Daunte Culpepper (80), Jon Kitna (84), Dan Orlovsky (73) and Drew Stanton (77) — vastly exceeded my rating.</p>
          <p>Factor in my shocking kicking performance (maybe I could make 95 percent of extra-point attempts on, say, the moon or some other low-gravity satellite), and I think that even my low stats fail to encapsulate just how bad (or rather how normal) I am. Madden&rsquo;s simulation is geared to work within a realm of athleticism that I am not a resident of. To articulate my actual performance on the field, I&rsquo;d probably need a negative rating.</p>
          <p>Despite the praise during practice — that I had more of an offensive-guard skill set, that I could be a tight end, that I was &ldquo;a real north and south kind of player&rdquo; — when it comes down to it, I&rsquo;m clumsy and awkward, my limbs don&rsquo;t quite go where I want them to go, and at best, it&rsquo;s just fun to watch me. Generally speaking, I don&rsquo;t think a regular person could compete with the pros. Most people are, at best, somewhat good at something. But greatness — regularly scheduled weekly articulations of greatness — is something that just can&rsquo;t be turned on.</p>
          <p>I asked Moore whether there were any sports that regular people could jump into and be somewhat competitive. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Poker, if you consider that a sport,&rdquo; he said.</p>
          <p>Mohegan Sun has <a href="http://mohegansun.com/playing/poker.html" target="_blank">a poker tournament</a> at the end of the month. How hard can that be?</p>
